          Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas
          traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in
          the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens
          when you build your app. Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM
          diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the
          state of your app changes.
